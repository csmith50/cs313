		<p> Here you can find all my assignments for CS313: Web deveopment 2. I am a student at BYUI
			and am a senior this year. I hope to graduate this year and continue onward into employment. 
			In terms of hobbies I enjoy playing competitive tekken and I love to listen to and play music.
			I play both guitar and bass (see pictures). I dream that one day I am skilled enough to write
		music and bring my own ideas into the world.</p>
